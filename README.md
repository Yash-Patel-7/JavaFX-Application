## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `out` folder by default.

## Important Libraries: Download .jar and .dylib files into lib folder.
